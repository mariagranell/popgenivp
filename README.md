# Population genetics IVP

This file is an organization of the specific genes and paths that I am intrested in. And while i wrtie this itÂ´s apparent to me the need to have a separate file addressing whihc are the genes I am intrested in and another txt file of those sequences.

1. Gene selection

| Category    | Gene  | Gene action                | Behavior         |
|-------------|-------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Afiliative  | OPRM1 | mu-opioid receptor         | adiction         |
|             | OXTR  | oxytocin repector          | social bonds     |
| Agonistic   | MAOA  | monoamine oxidase A        | aggression       |
|             | AVPR  | arginine-vasopresine genes | social agonistic |
|             | 5-HTT SLC6A4 | serotonine promoter        | aggression       |
|             | ?     | melatonine                 | aggression       |
| Personality | DRD4  | dopamine receptor          | novelty seeking  |

2. Reference genome: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/409/795/GCA_000409795.2_Chlorocebus_sabeus_1.1/
3. Gene search in NCBI, all sequences can be found in the file "bhv_biomarkers". All sequences are obtained from the NCBI website and from the species *Chlorocebus sabeus*
4. Blast of the sequences against genome
