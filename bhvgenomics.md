# Behavioural biomarkers

Collection of genes that have proven to be relevant in the study of animal behaviour. A great collection of this genes have been studied in humans, in clinical populations.

These recollection has the intention of promote the integration of genetic variation into the study of animal behavior.

| Category    | Gene  | Gene action                | Behavior         |
|-------------|-------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Afiliative  | OPRM1 | mu-opioid receptor         | adiction         |
|             | OXTR  | oxytocin repector          | social bonds     |
| Agonistic   | MAOA  | monoamine oxidase A        | aggression       |
|             | AVPR  | arginine-vasopresine genes | social agonistic |
|             | 5-HTT SLC6A4 | serotonine promoter        | aggression       |
|             | ?     | melatonine                 | aggression       |
| Personality | DRD4  | dopamine receptor          | novelty seeking  |

## 1) Polymorphisims for sociality

### 1.1) OPRM1 mu-opioid receptor gene

Variation in this gene is related with adiction propensity. It has also been related with anxiety and social bond forming.

### 1.1) OXTR oxytocin receptor

OT is one of the main hormones related to the creation of social bonds and affiliative behaviour together with AVP. Polymorphismis of this gene have been related with different psychiatric traits.

## 2) Polymorphisims for aggresive behaviour

### 2.1) MAOA monoamine oxidase A

Gene related with agressive behaviour

### 2.2) AVPR arginine-vasopresine

3 genes associated with the creating of social bonds and agonitic behaviours. Little research has been done on the implications of this polymorphisims for bahviour

### 2.3) 5-HTT serotonine promoter

This gene polymorphisims have been associated in the literature with personality and agression blue tits and Rhesus monkeys.

When entering 5-HTT in NCBI it refers to a different gene SLC6A4 solute carrier family 6 member 4. I am not exactly sure what this means. Probably that 5HTT is embeses in this gene ??

### 2.4) melatonine?

Melatonization has been associated with aggressive behaviour in several taxa, however I couldn't find yet a candidate gene. Names I have been researching: CBD103 and ASMT

## 3) Polymorphisims in personality

### 3.1) DRD4 dopamine receptor

Different versions of this genes were able to explain 13% of the variation in novelty seeking behaviours in Rhesus monkyes.
